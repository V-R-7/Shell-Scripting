# Shell Scripting

This is a series of tutorial for learning shell script.

## Basics

A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell/ Linux shell.

Basically we can make use of it for automated mode of running an operating system shell(UNIX).
The shell is a command line interpreter i.e., which means it translates user commands to language understood by Kernel. 

### Kernel

What is kernel of an OS?
The kernel is the most important part of the operating system. It is the primary interface between the hardware and the processes of a computer. It has full control over everything in the system.

It manages disk management, control memory management, task management,resource management.

Each operation of hardware and software is managed and administrated by the kernel.

The shell is an utility that processes your requests, so when an user gives a command it interprets the command and call the program you have given.


## Operations

Typical operations performed by shell scripts are 
- file manipulation,
- program execution, 
- printing text

## Types of Shells

- The Bourne Shell
- The C Shell
- The Korn Shell
- The GNU Bourne-Again Shell

The default Shell considered for many Linux distros - GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash)

## Extension Bash Script

- It has file extension of .sh.
- It can run fine without the sh extension aswell.

## First line Bash Script

The first line of a Bash Script starts as with combined hash and exclamation.
i.e., #!

This #! indicates the shell to execute via bash shell.

Example of this statement below :

```
#! /bin/bash

```
However, this above path of the program can change.
